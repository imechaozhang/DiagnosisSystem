    "# Diagnosis System Demo\n",
    "This demo shows how our diagnosis system work. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "While we have a lot of resources in the US, African people are suffering from high disease burden and reletively low information technology development. We are aiming to design a diagnosis system for them to help ease the disease burden. \n",
    "Although many US diagnosis systems are working well, the target diseases are quite different from African infectious diseases, which are the main cause of death there. In the mean time, due to a limited access of internet in Africa, US systems are not able to work there.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "We are aiming to develop a diagnosis system for Africa people. The system will be able to work offline, while high accuracy and broad spectrum are maintained. \n",
    "We have access to IBM MarketScan medical records and DeepDive text corpus data set, and we collected some common diseases and their corresponding symptoms, both in the US and in Nigeria, the largest country in Africa. \n",
    "The system is designed as following:\n",
    "### Data preparing\n",
    "IBM MarketScan medical records are used to summarized the frequency of different diseases and serve as a prior probability of diagnosis.\n",
    "DeepDive corpus works as training data for the association between diseases and symptoms. The method we use is Word2Vec within gensim library. Combining with the disease information we collected, an association matrix is formed and this matrix is used for an adaptive diagnosis as followed.\n",
    "### Adaptive diagnosis\n",
    "Given the disease-symptom association, and the inputs from the patient, we are able to filter out possible diagnosises for the patient. With a list of possible diagnosis, a reduced association matrix is formed and the most informative symptom is asked. After the answer from the patient is got, the matrix is further reduced. \n",
    "Finally the matrix is reduced to only one line and the diagnosis is done. In this way, not only the final diagnosis result is shown, but also other possible diseases. This is because we have collected a list of symptoms, multiplied by the association matrix, we actually get the probabilities for all disease in our list."
