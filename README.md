# Diagnosis system developed by Chao Zhang at Rzhetsky lab in University of Chicago

Under-developed countries are suffering from severe disease burden and lackof physicians.  We developed a computerized diagnosis system which can helpdoctors to make more accurate and comprehensive diagnosis for a broad rangeof diseases.  This system is adaptive with the minimum number of queries toachieve a swift diagnosis experience, and it leverages several large data sets(electronic medical records and literature) as well as the data accumulatedwhile  the  system  is  being  used,  so  it  will  be  more  ‘experienced’  than  anyclinician.   We  hope  this  diagnosis  system  can  benefit  the  under-developedcountries such as Pakistan, Rwanda and Nigeria.  The aim of our system isto help physicians to make diagnosis faster.  Based on large databases, theadaptive diagnosis procedure, and the online learning algorithm, our systemwill provide the physicians with accurate and comprehensive suggestions onthe patients’ possible diseases and corresponding tests and treatments.The development of the system is still ongoing and the project is com-pletely open source.  Anyone who are interested are welcomed to discuss andcontribute.
